# _Beep-Boop & Numbers_

#### _Epicodus independent project #3, August 17, 2018_

## Description
A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

* Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program the number 10 should be replaced with "Boop!", and the number 30 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Clone the following repository: https://github.com/VicOhPNW/beep-boop.git
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Enter and submit a number into the application and submit for a return.
